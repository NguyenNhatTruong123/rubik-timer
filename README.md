This project I implement from this repo: https://github.com/Nilesh-Saini-09/Rubiks-Cube-Timer-v2.git

I modified a little bit like: 
1. Add event 6x6 and 7x7
2. Change scramble generator algorithm.
3. Delete solve one by one
4. Drawing scramble (thanks to repo https://github.com/cubing/scramble-display.git) 
5. Congratulations when you got a new Personal Best.
6. Confirmation when delete all your result.
